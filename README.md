## Snake Game

- It is a simple snake game with a theme inspired by 'No-Face' from Spirited Away.
- Turtle is used for this game.
- We are all aware of how after consuming a greedy toad, No-Face only sought to consume as much food as possible.
He gulped down tons of food in a go. No-face does the same here! Help him grab as many snacks as possible but BEWARE of the poison.

### How to play

- Press arrow keys or a,s,d,e keys to move No-face in the desired direction.
- Try to eat all the pastries visible on screen to earn 10 points.
- After every 30 seconds, a bonus cereal appears for 5 seconds. Eating this helps you earn 30 points extra.
- Beaware of poison that appears at any random position after every 50 seconds. Eat this and you lose 50 points.
- Make sure not to touch the boundaries or your own body with your head. Game is over if you do so.
